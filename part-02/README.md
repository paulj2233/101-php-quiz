<!-- Your response goes here. -->1) Added another question and answer variable to the $quiz and $answer array's in the quiz.php file
2) Changed the tag "<form action>" in my question4.php file from "<form action = results.php>" to "<form action = question5.php>"
3) Copy and pasted all of the php and html text from question4.php to question5.php
4) Changed the form action tag just like in step 2, but this time changed it to "<form action = results.php>"
5) Lastly, I changed "<?php echo $quiz[3]; ?>" to "<?php echo $quiz[4]; ?>"
