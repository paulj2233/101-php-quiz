## Part Three: Refactoring your Work

---

As you reflected in your writing prompt, every time you want to add a new question to your quiz, you have to add a new file. 

In this part of the assignment, use the starter code to help you refactor your work to dynamically populate questions and pass query parameters on the same page.

Work with the code in **starter.php** and make changes to the portions that are commented out, and then customize it to be your own quiz and set of answers.
